Emoji Cipher Challenge 

## Description

Let's build a cipher using emoji. High five!

To complete this goal, you'll create a Node.js module that exports two functions: one to encode a string of alphanumeric characters into emoji, and another to decode an emoji message to the original string.

Here's an example usage:


| Encode        | Decode        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| we love you   | ‚ôä‚ú® ‚≠êüöÄ‚õ©‚ú® üçâüöÄ‚õ∞| 


## Context

A cipher is "a secret or disguised way of writing; a code" (source: [Google](https://www.google.com/#q=cipher)). Technically, a cipher is a mapping between two sets of symbolsTranslating between different representations of data is a such a common task in programming, and a cipher is a good (and fun) way to become familiar with this process.

## Specifications

- [x] Code is packaged as a module that exports (at least) the two functions `encode` and `decode`.
- [x] Exported functions can encode and decode alphanumeric characters to/from emoji.
- [x] Test Driven Development
- [x] Interface is user friendly and attractive
- [x] Deployed to <ahref='https://emojicipher.herokuapp.com/'>Heroku </a> 
- [x] All source code is written using ECMAScript 2015 syntax.
- [x] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].
